FIRST Ladies is a program that was created in collaboration with the Patronum Bots, an American FTC team. It promotes and supports women in STEM technology and FIRST, and through a range of online resources and events we have been able to reach a huge number of girls. There are thousands of members worldwide, and the number grows with every event we are at.
We hold a FIRST Ladies tea at every event we host or attend. Over the years, we have run dozens of breakfasts and teas from Sydney to Duluth Minnesota, Beijing China, and more!
At each of FIRST Ladies events we bring in a guest speaker to talk to all that attend about why FIRST Ladies and women in STEM are important.
In just the past year we have reached 1200 girls. These teas are a great opportunity for girls to connect with other like-minded individuals and build a strong network. Walking around the space, girls can often be found laughing and sharing stories about their FIRST experiences.
