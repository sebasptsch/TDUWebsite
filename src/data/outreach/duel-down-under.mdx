DDU or Duel Down Under is Australia's largest unofficial off-season event, founded by Team 3132 in 2012.
Our team annually opens our workshop and practice field to teams and involves running, supporting, and organizing the logistics of the event.
We started Duel Down Under in response to the limited access to events in Australia that hinders many teams from practicing and inspiring their students during the long off-season. 

Events like Duel Down Under play a crucial role in promoting sustainability within teams by offering newer members the opportunity to gain experience in a competitive environment and develop technical and transferable skills.
Moreover, Duel Down Under provides teams that missed official events with a chance to compete in a similar environment.
It also enables higher-level teams to enhance their robots, addressing aspects they may not have had time to complete during the build season.
