Inspired by our existing Robo Camps model, we were challenged by Macquarie Alumni to transplant this model to poorer rural regions with the intention of assisting these communities incorporate the Robo camps curriculum into their education. Thanks to the support from the Chi Wah foundation based in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, they sponsored our team and FRC team 1678 The Citrus Circuits to collaboratively teach other high school and middle school students how to use LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robots. This was achieved by designing fun challenges and goals for the students to strive towards where they can pick up new skills as well as refine their english capabilities through interaction with native english speakers. This also strengthened our student mentors teaching capabilities through trying to overcome the language barriers.
