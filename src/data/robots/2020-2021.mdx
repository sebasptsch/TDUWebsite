This robot was designed for the 2020 season of the FIRST robotics competition, INFINITE RECHARGE.
Due to the events of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020/2021 competition was cancelled, and the robot was built and played in an unofficial 2021 competition.
The robot was capable of an impressive 8-ball automated routine, scoring the high goal from the various points within the field.
