Developed for the 2024 season of the FIRST robotics competition, CRESCENDO presented by Haas. Baakan is appropriately named after its size in speed, utilised by the local First Nations dialect to mean “ankle biter”. Baakan was designed to be small, mobile, and versatile. Capable of speedily travelling across the field within seconds, the robot is able to score in a low goal denoted the “amp”, a high goal denoted the “speaker” and climb on a large structure denoted the “stage”. 

Fun Fact: the robot is so small that it was able to travel disassembled in suitcases internationally and built in a hotel room in 5 hours.
